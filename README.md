# Tradespace Analyzer for Drone Design

The Tradespace Analyzer for Drone Design is a powerful tool that allows designers to analyze various options and design attributes of drone configurations. The system leverages state-of-the-art methods, as presented in the "A Practical Performance Evaluation Method for Electric Multicopters" article by the creators of the FlyEval website, to model the relationships between drone parameters such as battery specifications, motors, and propellers.

## Key Features

- **Tradespace Analysis**: The system performs tradespace analysis, exploring multiple design options and generating the Pareto front for each configuration. This enables designers to evaluate and compare different design choices based on various performance criteria.

- **Model-Driven Design**: By integrating model-driven design principles, the system provides a structured approach for designing drones. Designers can input specific parameters and constraints, and the system will generate optimized configurations based on the defined criteria.

- **Optimization and Decision Support**: The Tradespace Analyzer offers optimization capabilities to identify the best configuration for a given set of requirements. It assists designers in making informed decisions by providing comprehensive performance evaluations and visualizations of the design space.

- **Flexibility and Adaptability**: The system allows users to customize and expand the design space by incorporating new components, performance metrics, and optimization algorithms. This flexibility enables the exploration of novel designs and the integration of emerging technologies.

## Usage

To use the Tradespace Analyzer for Drone Design, follow these steps:

1. **Initialize UAV Model**: Create an instance of the `UAVModel` class.

```python
uav = UAVModel()
```

2. **Set Input Parameters**: Set the desired input parameters for the UAV model. These parameters include temperature, altitude, mass, propeller specifications, motor characteristics, battery specifications, and more. Example:

```python
uav.setAll(temp=25, h=10, mass=14.7 / uav.g, Dp=10, Hp=4.5, Bp=2, Kv0=890, Um0=10, Im0=0.5,
           Rm=0.101, nr=4, Re=0.008, Ub=12, Cb=5000, Cmin=5000 * 0.2, Rb=0.01, Icontrol=1, safe_duty_cycle=0.8)
```

3. **Show Configuration**: Display the configured input parameters of the UAV model.

```python
uav.show_config()
```

4. **Calculate Performance**: Perform the calculation of the UAV model's performance based on the input parameters.

```python
uav.calculate_performance()
```

5. **Show Performance**: Display the calculated performance metrics of the UAV model.

```python
uav.show_performance()
```

6. **Tradespace Analysis and Optimization**: You can further explore the tradespace by modifying the input parameters and repeating steps 3 to 5. Adjust the parameters and constraints to optimize the design according to your specific requirements.

7. **Customization and Expansion**: The Tradespace Analyzer allows customization and expansion of the design space by incorporating new components, performance metrics, and optimization algorithms. Refer to the user documentation for details on how to extend the functionality to meet your specific needs.

For detailed instructions on installation, additional usage examples, and customization options, please refer to the user documentation.
